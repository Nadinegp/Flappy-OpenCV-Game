# Flappy-OpenCV-Game
A simple game flappy-bird like the controls here are the camera where it reads the hand gesture when it 5 fingers are up

Create a new conda enviroment and downaload the libraries in the requirements.txt file and play the script runner_class.py where it will detect hands with only 5 fingers up.

for any hand position recognition use runner_class only.py

To play using your laptop camera:
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

For webcam that connects through HDMI
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)

:))) happy gaming.
